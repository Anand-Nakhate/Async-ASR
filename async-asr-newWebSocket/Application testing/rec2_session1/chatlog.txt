It's really not that hard to go, uh, to go in, go there and just start to shop, because i just because.  : 12:05:21

One : Uh.  : 12:07:21
One : Your mother lah.  : 12:07:29
One : Right.  : 12:07:50

Two : Yeah. Mainly for shopping for local enthusiasts to users.  : 12:08:15
One : Okay.  : 12:08:20
One : Yeah.  : 12:08:26
One : So i guess it's like going to orchard. Where do where do you normally hang out?  : 12:08:29
Two : Er, so in my free time, normally i don't hang out to go. I don't really go out and like shop or go to malls are most of the time is either a b in training or work or.  : 12:08:47
One : Uh.  : 12:09:02
One : Wah.  : 12:09:34
Two : Just staying at home most of the time. Yah. Cause i don't really do that too much things outside, but if i were to go out my friends and hang out normally, i will just, er.  : 12:09:38
One : Oh.  : 12:09:45
One : A lot of like  : 12:10:00
Two : Or go to those, er, not so famous. Smalls, or yah. Batteries, that, so that i can just go there. Do i need to do? The crowd is not that bad.  : 12:10:14
One : Ya.  : 12:10:23
One : Yeah.  : 12:10:39
Two : And also, at the end of day, just sit down somewhere and then like, just you around, yeah.  : 12:10:42
One : The chill and hang out a lot more. So, i mean, i'll be here for a year.  : 12:10:52
One : A lot of time to explore. All singapore will want more.  : 12:11:11
One : There are not so crowded.  : 12:11:23
Two : Uh. One of the most that i think it's, er, quite good to school. And it's also not well known.  : 12:11:27
One : Oh.  : 12:11:43
Two : Actually nearby my workplace which is a at sixth avenue mrt. But the problem is there's a. This is quite a distance to the more, because you have to take the shuttle bus either. Who can work? That will take the shuttle bus, you can go there. It's called grandstand. So like over there, there's a lot of, er, there's one big supermarket, and then there's also this place called pasarbella where they sell all the.  : 12:11:45
One : Yeah.  : 12:12:15
One : Yeah.  : 12:12:31
Two : The fresh meats and all those.  : 12:12:47
Two : It's not a normal supermarket lah. So like you will find a lot of  : 12:12:58
One : You know?  : 12:13:03
Two : Things that it's very hard to find normally in normal supermarkets in singapore.  : 12:13:12
One : Right.  : 12:13:19
Two : Yeah.  : 12:13:26
Two : Er, there's also many activities you can do around there. So, uh. As i think, if you are going to be here for a while, the main, the shopping malls will always be there. But i think the main thing you should focus on is doing all the activities you can do in singapore, all the fun areas, or you can do, because that's where the fund is instead of just shopping around.  : 12:13:30
One : Oh.  : 12:13:51
One : Okay.  : 12:14:07
Two : So around that area, there's also a few activities you can do, er. There's, er.  : 12:14:31
One : Okay.  : 12:14:39
Two : I can ride horses there. A paintball archery. Ah, yah. You can play football there also.  : 12:14:49
Two : Uh, yeah. And, er. Across, er. Ya. If you don't know, basically another ballgame. Yeah. So other than that place, er. Normally would go to, uh.  : 12:15:09
One : Yeah.  : 12:15:27
One : Yeah.  : 12:15:43
Two : Woodlands. Ah.  : 12:15:44
One : The  : 12:15:46
Two : Er, woodlands, mainly because my friends, most of my friends stay there, so i will just go woodlands, and just hang around, if not. Ah yah.  : 12:15:50
One : Yeah.  : 12:16:03
Two : Police are normally go. You just buona vista because that's where i stay, so yah. It's not. Yeah, there's nothing i don't know, eh? Where else i would normally.  : 12:16:15

Two : Yeah.  : 12:16:42
One : Buona vista.  : 12:16:48
Two : Yeah, that's, uh, one more call the star vista.  : 12:16:54
Two : So, uh. But i don't really recommended place mainly because there's not much shopping to do is most of its food, so there's a lot of food there. But it's not. It's not the local food, so i don't know whether bore you or not.  : 12:17:03
One : The  : 12:17:11
Two : Uh. Other than that, there's like.  : 12:17:51
Two : Rochester. Rochester and whatnot? I i find that plays as a rich people place, so i think it's quite boring, the honestly, for me.  : 12:18:02
Two : Ya, so i don't really recommend that place to you. Yeah?  : 12:18:28
One : Yeah.  : 12:18:31
Two : Yeah.  : 12:18:43
One : Colombia.  : 12:18:47

One : The food.  : 12:19:35
Two : Neon. Bali gateway. Poly. There's a lot of, er. There's a few food courts are. There's a one at the fukuoka poolside. Uh. Mainly the what was people go there maybe just for the mala gave me my life, basically, a chinese dish, but not so much of a local cuisine.  : 12:19:37
One : The  : 12:19:53
Two : Then, er.  : 12:20:35
One : Okay.  : 12:20:39
Two : There you can try the malay store, there. Ah. It's not bad, but, uh.  : 12:20:39
Two : It's just school food. So it's not that great, then? Ah, that place. Er. There's also one recall. Ah.  : 12:20:55
One : Yeah.  : 12:21:11
Two : Food club there, over there, that sells a book, or like a local cuisine, like chicken rice and, er, those, er, ban mian. Wheat noodles.  : 12:21:19
One : The  : 12:21:22
Two : A lot of people that go there. Yeah. So i think they don't really have much of a good local cuisines. They do. You normally have like food from other countries. Yah. But yah, not much lah.  : 12:21:48
One : Yeah.  : 12:22:15
One : Okay.  : 12:22:31
One : Like singapore.  : 12:22:43
One : The country, as you like.  : 12:22:50
One : Normally, they're like the original inhabitants of this country.  : 12:22:58
One : Introduced me.  : 12:23:13
One : Try.  : 12:23:21
Two : A malay dishes that you should try, uh. Most of the time, when i want to eat malay food, i would go to the. Uh.  : 12:23:26
One : Uh.  : 12:23:40
One : Market?  : 12:23:55
Two : Market near my place and then they will normally sell like  : 12:23:55
Two : A lot of dishes are people. Normally people will just try the typical things that they pick them because they are they are too afraid to try or they don't know what's the other dish. So one of these that i actually like myself is called paru, is the lungs, so his accounts. Lungs and they may.  : 12:24:11
One : Ya.  : 12:24:26
One : Yeah.  : 12:24:42
One : Oh.  : 12:24:44
One : Okay.  : 12:25:03
Two : Fry it or they mix it with some kind of a chilly. Uh. Yeah. It's quite nice. Lah. Some people don't like it. I myself love it. I always order it all the time.  : 12:25:12
One : The  : 12:25:30
Two : Then there's also another malay dish, sambal sotong, sotong, hitam soto. Eaten basically, means black squid. So it's basically squid with some black like sauce with it. And then sambal sotong is basically.  : 12:25:39
One : The  : 12:25:46
One : Yeah.  : 12:26:18
Two : Squid with chilli paste. Yah. Then. Uh. There's also lemak, cili padi.  : 12:26:26
Two : He's like a coconut.  : 12:26:43
Two : Broth with, like, chili padi with it, like busy with chili is a spicy a dish with a chicken. Yah. Then, er, lastly, my favorite one would be ayam masak merah, which directly translates to read, cook chicken, the english. So it's just the first friday chicken. And then they just cook it in a very  : 12:26:52
One : We were  : 12:27:22
One : Ya.  : 12:27:38
One : The  : 12:27:54
Two : Uh i wouldn't say it's a normal, typical sambal sauce. This is slightly different ma'mor. Much more fragrant, much more flavourful. And, of course, the chilli is always. The spiciness is always there. So if you are able to endure spiciness, then. Yeah, i think any malay dish as long. I think she just behind.  : 12:27:54
One : The  : 12:28:10
One : Ya.  : 12:28:42
Two : Ventures and just try wherever dishes from their own, yeah  : 12:28:55

Two : Yeah.  : 12:31:09
One : The more common ones.  : 12:31:11
One : They can't remember.  : 12:31:18
Two : Kueh lapis. But i'm very confused. As we shall reach, because there's two types. If i'm not wrong, one is the rainbow one, and one is like.  : 12:31:21
One : Uh-huh  : 12:31:37
One : Of all the  : 12:31:41

Two : Triangle, coconut and the coupon black sauce on top, some thing like that, which yah. That's why i'm very confused. I don't i. I see. I know it. Just tried that before, so, yeah. But in the malay, for malay foods. Kueh is something we're. I'm not so adventurous. I only eat those that i like.  : 12:31:58
One : Orh.  : 12:32:01
One : Oh.  : 12:32:08
One : I see.  : 12:32:29

Two : Drinks.  : 12:33:15
One : Yeah.  : 12:33:17
One : Leveraging the  : 12:33:20
Two : Uh, yeah. So the unique thing about a malay cuisine in terms of drinks, yeah.  : 12:33:21
Two : I see it as they are just basically mixing stuff together then serving it like that. So like there's this thing called a  : 12:33:39
One : Yeah.  : 12:33:42
Two : I syrup limau. So asia rimau basically means, er, ice syrup with a line. So the syrup they use is the rose syrup. The same syrup. They used to make a bandung, but without. But so, basically syrup that mimics bandung, but without the. Uh. The milk. So it's just the syrup itself.  : 12:34:08
One : Ya.  : 12:34:09
One : Ya.  : 12:34:26
One : Right.  : 12:34:42
One : No  : 12:35:05
Two : Water ice, and then they just put your mind? So, uh. I like that during. Because, uh. It's like sweet and sour a bit, so it's not so boring.  : 12:35:10
One : Ya.  : 12:35:29
Two : And it's quite refreshing also then, er.  : 12:35:44
One : Oh.  : 12:35:44

One : The  : 12:36:52
One : The happier  : 12:37:00
Two : Yeah. So, so the basically. Episode.  : 12:37:05
Two : Weird name.  : 12:37:15
Two : Suda with bandung, basically, yeah.  : 12:37:25

Two : Yeah, so it's just kind of a dishes that, i think, that. I don't know. I'm quite confused with the food there, compared to the normal chinese cuisine or local cuisine that you see around singapore. But i think you should just try orders. Funny, weird. Ah. Food out there.  : 12:41:32
One : The  : 12:41:59
One : Yeah.  : 12:42:31
Two : Then maybe you can tell the difference because i, myself also don't know.  : 12:42:31

Two : Chinese food, my family. We go to. Downstairs, the phuket, my house. I read this restaurant so like.  : 12:45:23
Two : I know, they order a lot of dishes, but.  : 12:45:48
Two : I only know them by their english name, so there's, like, cereal prawns, very normal cereal prawns. And then there's this, er.  : 12:45:57
Two : Uh. Hotplate.  : 12:46:23
Two : Beancurd and egg hotplate, something like that. There is some prawns on it.  : 12:46:31
Two : Then, er.  : 12:46:47
Two : Ya then kangkong chilli sambal, kangkong then, um.  : 12:46:51
Two : Yeah, it just very typical chinese dishes that we see around, but for indian dishes i think, uh roti prata will be a very common indian dish. Ah.  : 12:47:07
One : The  : 12:47:19
Two : And it's also quite unique cause is a dish that can be eaten at anytime of the day.  : 12:47:45
Two : You can either in the morning for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Or maybe even supper or people like to eat roti prata, maybe after late night out, hanging out with your friends, you just go to a nearby. Ah.  : 12:48:07
One : The  : 12:48:35
Two : Indian restaurant or indian place, and then they just eat a practice with their friends.  : 12:48:43
Two : Er, they can. Supporters are basically, um.  : 12:48:58
Two : Those. Ah, yah.  : 12:49:10
Two : They are just. I'm not really sure how he made, but i see it's just those ideas stretch and then they just cook. Only spent. And the good thing is that you can make funny types of flavoring on the interpreter. So then, obviously, there's a plain wishes to do it. And then there's, uh. Other things and onions.  : 12:49:14
One : Yeah.  : 12:49:55
Two : Cheese.  : 12:50:16
Two : Chocolate, so you can go from sweet to savory. So even from your own. A filipino cuisine, maybe in whatever. Uh. Things that you like to eat as a snack at home too. And then you just add it to the prata. I think you still work is right. Yeah.  : 12:50:20
