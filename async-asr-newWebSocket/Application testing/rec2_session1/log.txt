called
called
posting text:  shopping.

called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  easy to find a more because they're all like side by side i think going there you'll be able to easily find whatever most you need you want to find and even if you don't know the mosque you can just simply just go in and from there you can just find out it's really not that hard to go uh to go in go there and just start to shop because i just because.
called
called
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  ion orchard is the moment you step out of out from a orchard mrt ion orchard is already there so maybe can start for my own then from there there are some links or some tunnels at least two other muslims from that you can just start to explore.
called
posting text:  so like what kind of moss.
called
posting text:  uh.
called
posting text:  your mother lah.
called
called
posting text:  right.
called
posting text:  uh i don't think i remember cause i usually i myself also i don't really remember so i just go there i also find er if i'm alone i just go there walk until like i cannot i cannot call my friend or or use google maps time yah don't really go there often yeah.
called
posting text:  so i suppose.
called
posting text:  am i supposed to orchard is a place to shop right.
posting text:  okay.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah mainly for shopping for local enthusiasts to users.
called
called
posting text:  so i guess it's like going to orchard where do where do you normally hang out.
called
posting text:  uh.
called
called
called
posting text:  wah.
called
posting text:  er so in my free time normally i don't hang out to go i don't really go out and like shop or go to malls are most of the time is either a b in training or work or.
called
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  a lot of like.
posting text:  just staying at home most of the time yah cause i don't really do that too much things outside but if i were to go out my friends and hang out normally i will just er.
called
posting text:  ya.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  or go to those er not so famous smalls or yah batteries that so that i can just go there do i need to do the crowd is not that bad.
called
called
posting text:  and also at the end of day just sit down somewhere and then like just you around yeah.
called
posting text:  the chill and hang out a lot more so i mean i'll be here for a year.
called
posting text:  a lot of time to explore all singapore will want more.
called
posting text:  there are not so crowded.
called
posting text:  oh.
posting text:  uh one of the most that i think it's er quite good to school and it's also not well known.
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  actually nearby my workplace which is a at sixth avenue mrt but the problem is there's a this is quite a distance to the more because you have to take the shuttle bus either who can work that will take the shuttle bus you can go there it's called grandstand so like over there there's a lot of er there's one big supermarket and then there's also this place called pasarbella where they sell all the.
called
posting text:  the fresh meats and all those.
posting text:  you know.
called
posting text:  it's not a normal supermarket lah so like you will find a lot of.
called
posting text:  right.
posting text:  things that it's very hard to find normally in normal supermarkets in singapore.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  okay.
called
called
posting text:  er there's also many activities you can do around there so uh as i think if you are going to be here for a while the main the shopping malls will always be there but i think the main thing you should focus on is doing all the activities you can do in singapore all the fun areas or you can do because that's where the fund is instead of just shopping around.
called
posting text:  okay.
called
posting text:  so around that area there's also a few activities you can do er there's er.
called
called
posting text:  i can ride horses there a paintball archery ah yah you can play football there also.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  uh yeah and er across er ya if you don't know basically another ballgame yeah so other than that place er normally would go to uh.
called
posting text:  the.
posting text:  woodlands ah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  er woodlands mainly because my friends most of my friends stay there so i will just go woodlands and just hang around if not ah yah.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  police are normally go you just buona vista because that's where i stay so yah it's not yeah there's nothing i don't know eh where else i would normally.
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  buona vista.
posting text:  yeah that's uh one more call the star vista.
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  so uh but i don't really recommended place mainly because there's not much shopping to do is most of its food so there's a lot of food there but it's not it's not the local food so i don't know whether bore you or not.
called
posting text:  uh other than that there's like.
called
called
called
posting text:  rochester rochester and whatnot i i find that plays as a rich people place so i think it's quite boring the honestly for me.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  ya so i don't really recommend that place to you yeah.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  colombia.
called
called
posting text:  try.
posting text:  singapore.
posting text:  four.
called
called
posting text:  the employee has to offer.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  so.
posting text:  the food.
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  neon bali gateway poly there's a lot of er there's a few food courts are there's a one at the fukuoka poolside uh mainly the what was people go there maybe just for the mala gave me my life basically a chinese dish but not so much of a local cuisine.
called
posting text:  then er.
posting text:  okay.
called
posting text:  there you can try the malay store there ah it's not bad but uh.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  it's just school food so it's not that great then ah that place er there's also one recall ah.
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
posting text:  food club there over there that sells a book or like a local cuisine like chicken rice and er those er ban mian wheat noodles.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  a lot of people that go there yeah so i think they don't really have much of a good local cuisines they do you normally have like food from other countries yah but yah not much lah.
posting text:  okay.
called
called
posting text:  like singapore.
posting text:  the country as you like.
called
called
posting text:  normally they're like the original inhabitants of this country.
called
posting text:  introduced me.
posting text:  try.
called
called
posting text:  uh.
called
posting text:  a malay dishes that you should try uh most of the time when i want to eat malay food i would go to the uh.
called
posting text:  market.
called
posting text:  market near my place and then they will normally sell like.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  okay.
posting text:  a lot of dishes are people normally people will just try the typical things that they pick them because they are they are too afraid to try or they don't know what's the other dish so one of these that i actually like myself is called paru is the lungs so his accounts lungs and they may.
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  fry it or they mix it with some kind of a chilly uh yeah it's quite nice lah some people don't like it i myself love it i always order it all the time.
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  then there's also another malay dish sambal sotong sotong hitam soto eaten basically means black squid so it's basically squid with some black like sauce with it and then sambal sotong is basically.
called
called
posting text:  squid with chilli paste yah then uh there's also lemak cili padi.
called
posting text:  he's like a coconut.
called
called
called
posting text:  we were.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  broth with like chili padi with it like busy with chili is a spicy a dish with a chicken yah then er lastly my favorite one would be ayam masak merah which directly translates to read cook chicken the english so it's just the first friday chicken and then they just cook it in a very.
posting text:  the.
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  uh i wouldn't say it's a normal typical sambal sauce this is slightly different ma'mor much more fragrant much more flavourful and of course the chilli is always the spiciness is always there so if you are able to endure spiciness then yeah i think any malay dish as long i think she just behind.
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  ventures and just try wherever dishes from their own yeah.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  really.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  like many.
called
posting text:  the malay kueh.
called
called
posting text:  really.
called
posting text:  i know how it looks like.
called
called
called
posting text:  uh i don't really know the names of the quiz cause i just grew up eating them really know what is it i know how it looks like yah but i don't really know the names because you don't really don't i don't i don't eat much chorizo and also boarded with it.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  the more common ones.
posting text:  they can't remember.
called
called
posting text:  uh-huh.
posting text:  of all the.
called
posting text:  kueh lapis but i'm very confused as we shall reach because there's two types if i'm not wrong one is the rainbow one and one is like.
posting text:  the triangle one.
called
posting text:  the brown a triangle.
called
posting text:  orh.
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  i see.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  triangle coconut and the coupon black sauce on top some thing like that which yah that's why i'm very confused i don't i i see i know it just tried that before so yeah but in the malay for malay foods kueh is something we're i'm not so adventurous i only eat those that i like.
called
posting text:  yet do now i still don't know what's the name.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  drinks.
posting text:  leveraging the.
called
called
posting text:  uh yeah so the unique thing about a malay cuisine in terms of drinks yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  i see it as they are just basically mixing stuff together then serving it like that so like there's this thing called a.
posting text:  ya.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  right.
called
called
called
posting text:  no.
posting text:  i syrup limau so asia rimau basically means er ice syrup with a line so the syrup they use is the rose syrup the same syrup they used to make a bandung but without but so basically syrup that mimics bandung but without the uh the milk so it's just the syrup itself.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  water ice and then they just put your mind so uh i like that during because uh it's like sweet and sour a bit so it's not so boring.
posting text:  oh.
called
posting text:  and it's quite refreshing also then er.
called
posting text:  ya.
posting text:  ya the other drinks that i see.
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  that i know of which is in the indonesian cuisine not so much a malay cuisine but we still drink it in singapore it's called a soda gambier yah so is uh basically same thing ah it basically bandung with a carbohydrate drinks can be saved up on spread and yeah that's it.
posting text:  the happier.
called
posting text:  yeah so so the basically episode.
called
posting text:  weird name.
called
posting text:  what.
called
posting text:  suda with bandung basically yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah yeah.
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  anymore.
called
posting text:  a food items.
posting text:  ya.
called
called
posting text:  hmm.
called
posting text:  so like.
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  the chinese.
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  oh.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  pulut hitam is a dish where i know i'm not sure where does it originate from cars i've seen it in many different shop so but i know like pulut hitam is basically like red bean soup with coconut on top of it.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah uh mean there's another maybe cuisine like no.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  ya.
called
posting text:  okay quite well this is a penang food mainly because i work in a penang restaurant before with my uncle yah so they made they focus a lot of penang food like char kway teow i don't know why is that considered clinic but ya penang laksa.
called
posting text:  er.
posting text:  the.
called
called
posting text:  hokkien mee soup one the peppery soup and then er.
called
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah so it's just kind of a dishes that i think that i don't know i'm quite confused with the food there compared to the normal chinese cuisine or local cuisine that you see around singapore but i think you should just try orders funny weird ah food out there.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  then maybe you can tell the difference because i myself also don't know.
called
posting text:  the singapore.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  no.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  maybe.
called
called
posting text:  chinese.
called
called
posting text:  they are not so i do not know so much of a chinese food ah it's the same situation for i know it but i don't.
called
posting text:  oh.
posting text:  uh i mean i only know bak chor mee.
called
posting text:  quickly minced meat noodles.
called
posting text:  the.
posting text:  um yeah yeah i think that one is quite common ah.
called
called
posting text:  er i know there's other dishes there it because i'm i normally eat ah.
called
called
called
posting text:  chinese food my family we go to downstairs the phuket my house i read this restaurant so like.
called
posting text:  i know they order a lot of dishes but.
called
called
posting text:  i only know them by their english name so there's like cereal prawns very normal cereal prawns and then there's this er.
called
posting text:  uh hotplate.
called
called
posting text:  beancurd and egg hotplate something like that there is some prawns on it.
posting text:  then er.
called
posting text:  ya then kangkong chilli sambal kangkong then um.
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
posting text:  yeah it just very typical chinese dishes that we see around but for indian dishes i think uh roti prata will be a very common indian dish ah.
called
called
called
posting text:  and it's also quite unique cause is a dish that can be eaten at anytime of the day.
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
posting text:  you can either in the morning for breakfast lunch and dinner or maybe even supper or people like to eat roti prata maybe after late night out hanging out with your friends you just go to a nearby ah.
called
called
posting text:  indian restaurant or indian place and then they just eat a practice with their friends.
called
posting text:  er they can supporters are basically um.
posting text:  those ah yah.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  they are just i'm not really sure how he made but i see it's just those ideas stretch and then they just cook only spent and the good thing is that you can make funny types of flavoring on the interpreter so then obviously there's a plain wishes to do it and then there's uh other things and onions.
called
posting text:  cheese.
called
called
posting text:  the.
called
called
called
posting text:  chocolate so you can go from sweet to savory so even from your own a filipino cuisine maybe in whatever uh things that you like to eat as a snack at home too and then you just add it to the prata i think you still work is right yeah.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  jollibee.
called
posting text:  but.
posting text:  oh yeah.

grandstand so like over there there's a lot of er there's one big supermarket and then there's also this place called pasarbella where they sell all the. the fresh meats and all those. it's not a normal supermarket lah so like you will find a lot of. things that it's very hard to find normally in normal supermarkets in singapore. yeah. er there's also many activities you can do around there so uh as i think if you are going to be here for a while the main the shopping malls will always be there but i think the main thing you should focus on is doing all the activities you can do in singapore all the fun areas or you can do because that's where the fund is instead of just shopping around. so around that area there's also a few activities you can do er there's er. i can ride horses there a paintball archery ah yah you can play football there also. uh yeah and er across er ya if you don't know basically another ballgame yeah so other than that place er normally would go to uh. woodlands ah. er woodlands mainly because my friends most of my friends stay there so i will just go woodlands and just hang around if not ah yah. police are normally go you just buona vista because that's where i stay so yah it's not yeah there's nothing i don't know eh where else i would normally. yeah. yeah that's uh one more call the star vista. so uh but i don't really recommended place mainly because there's not much shopping to do is most of its food so there's a lot of food there but it's not it's not the local food so i don't know whether bore you or not. uh other than that there's like. rochester rochester and whatnot i i find that plays as a rich people place so i think it's quite boring the honestly for me. ya so i don't really recommend that place to you yeah. yeah. yeah. so. neon bali gateway poly there's a lot of er there's a few food courts are there's a one at the fukuoka poolside uh mainly the what was people go there maybe just for the mala gave me my life basically a chinese dish but not so much of a local cuisine. then er. there you can try the malay store there ah it's not bad but uh. it's just school food so it's not that great then ah that place er there's also one recall ah. food club there over there that sells a book or like a local cuisine like chicken rice and er those er ban mian wheat noodles. a lot of people that go there yeah so i think they don't really have much of a good local cuisines they do you normally have like food from other countries yah but yah not much lah. a malay dishes that you should try uh most of the time when i want to eat malay food i would go to the uh. market near my place and then they will normally sell like. a lot of dishes are people normally people will just try the typical things that they pick them because they are they are too afraid to try or they don't know what's the other dish so one of these that i actually like myself is called paru is the lungs so his accounts lungs and they may. fry it or they mix it with some kind of a chilly uh yeah it's quite nice lah some people don't like it i myself love it i always order it all the time. then there's also another malay dish sambal sotong sotong hitam soto eaten basically means black squid so it's basically squid with some black like sauce with it and then sambal sotong is basically. squid with chilli paste yah then uh there's also lemak cili padi. he's like a coconut. broth with like chili padi with it like busy with chili is a spicy a dish with a chicken yah then er lastly my favorite one would be ayam masak merah which directly translates to read cook chicken the english so it's just the first friday chicken and then they just cook it in a very. uh i wouldn't say it's a normal typical sambal sauce this is slightly different ma'mor much more fragrant much more flavourful and of course the chilli is always the spiciness is always there so if you are able to endure spiciness then yeah i think any malay dish as long i think she just behind. ventures and just try wherever dishes from their own yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. yeah. uh i don't really know the names of the quiz cause i just grew up eating them really know what is it i know how it looks like yah but i don't really know the names because you don't really don't i don't i don't eat much chorizo and also boarded with it. yeah. kueh lapis but i'm very confused as we shall reach because there's two types if i'm not wrong one is the rainbow one and one is like. the triangle one. triangle coconut and the coupon black sauce on top some thing like that which yah that's why i'm very confused i don't i i see i know it just tried that before so yeah but in the malay for malay foods kueh is something we're i'm not so adventurous i only eat those that i like. yet do now i still don't know what's the name. drinks. uh yeah so the unique thing about a malay cuisine in terms of drinks yeah. i see it as they are just basically mixing stuff together then serving it like that so like there's this thing called a. i syrup limau so asia rimau basically means er ice syrup with a line so the syrup they use is the rose syrup the same syrup they used to make a bandung but without but so basically syrup that mimics bandung but without the uh the milk so it's just the syrup itself. water ice and then they just put your mind so uh i like that during because uh it's like sweet and sour a bit so it's not so boring. and it's quite refreshing also then er. ya the other drinks that i see. that i know of which is in the indonesian cuisine not so much a malay cuisine but we still drink it in singapore it's called a soda gambier yah so is uh basically same thing ah it basically bandung with a carbohydrate drinks can be saved up on spread and yeah that's it. yeah so so the basically episode. weird name. suda with bandung basically yeah. yeah yeah. yeah. a food items. hmm. so like. pulut hitam is a dish where i know i'm not sure where does it originate from cars i've seen it in many different shop so but i know like pulut hitam is basically like red bean soup with coconut on top of it. yeah uh mean there's another maybe cuisine like no. okay quite well this is a penang food mainly because i work in a penang restaurant before with my uncle yah so they made they focus a lot of penang food like char kway teow i don't know why is that considered clinic but ya penang laksa. er. hokkien mee soup one the peppery soup and then er. yeah so it's just kind of a dishes that i think that i don't know i'm quite confused with the food there compared to the normal chinese cuisine or local cuisine that you see around singapore but i think you should just try orders funny weird ah food out there. then maybe you can tell the difference because i myself also don't know. yeah. yeah. they are not so i do not know so much of a chinese food ah it's the same situation for i know it but i don't. uh i mean i only know bak chor mee. quickly minced meat noodles. um yeah yeah i think that one is quite common ah. er i know there's other dishes there it because i'm i normally eat ah. chinese food my family we go to downstairs the phuket my house i read this restaurant so like. i know they order a lot of dishes but. i only know them by their english name so there's like cereal prawns very normal cereal prawns and then there's this er. uh hotplate. beancurd and egg hotplate something like that there is some prawns on it. then er. ya then kangkong chilli sambal kangkong then um. yeah it just very typical chinese dishes that we see around but for indian dishes i think uh roti prata will be a very common indian dish ah. and it's also quite unique cause is a dish that can be eaten at anytime of the day. you can either in the morning for breakfast lunch and dinner or maybe even supper or people like to eat roti prata maybe after late night out hanging out with your friends you just go to a nearby ah. indian restaurant or indian place and then they just eat a practice with their friends. er they can supporters are basically um. those ah yah. they are just i'm not really sure how he made but i see it's just those ideas stretch and then they just cook only spent and the good thing is that you can make funny types of flavoring on the interpreter so then obviously there's a plain wishes to do it and then there's uh other things and onions. cheese. chocolate so you can go from sweet to savory so even from your own a filipino cuisine maybe in whatever uh things that you like to eat as a snack at home too and then you just add it to the prata i think you still work is right yeah. yeah. yeah. oh yeah. i can yeah. okay. so. the attraction would be uh. i mean normally i will just tell people to go to sentosa offers a check out the the famous a beach that everyone goes to uh. over there i think is a good spot to to uh go to the beach relax and enjoy time with friends. uh because a lot of local people who like to go there so it's a good time it's a good place to have a friends come along a few and show you around and then er i know they do sell some food there but i'm not really sure what but then um. also there's also some activities there so then you can check out the nearby more er vivo. or you can go to other buyers to check out the casinos and what not ah. another tourist attraction that i would recommend is the new jewel changi airport ah. is very new i myself have not gone there yet but i heard it's a very good place for people to hang around and then see those very nice er waterfall and then there's some uh unique restaurant that is only at changi jewel like if i'm not wrong the pokemon centre where they sell all the. merchandise. and uh yeah all the way. orders unique restaurants there for er for tourists to check it out. hello. hi uh can i check if you guys still have the promotion for the uh. ebi burger. yeah. okay uh good so uh. i just need maybe like five of those burgers five those everywhere this and then uh all upsize ah but there's there's uh for a price ah. i just okay i just wanna be normal shaker fries but i don't want to talk so if you can just to add the salt in and then some of the uh. ebi burger i think to a very burgers don't put in the sauce ah. yah and then er the drinks or maybe one co one iced lemon tea one green tea once spread in one milo yah there'll be good yeah. yeah. forty dollars. sure. uh. block nine ghim moh road. yeah. yeah. okay. sure. er no nothing else. the session.mprof: Sampling memory every 0.1s
