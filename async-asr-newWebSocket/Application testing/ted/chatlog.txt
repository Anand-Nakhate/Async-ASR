ted : Ah.  : 14:55:07
ted : The  : 14:55:20
ted : When i first became a doctor.  : 14:55:32
ted : In between city, nigeria some thirty odd years ago.  : 14:55:40
ted : I was drawn to help people live full lives.  : 14:55:54
ted : But often, i found myself feeling impotent. Here i was, i was brand new doctor with all these skills. But i couldn't cure my patients who had chronic diseases, illnesses like heart disease, asthma, diabetes. It needed more than just handing them a prescription.  : 14:56:07
ted : Or providing brief counselling in the office to get the job done. Fast forward. Fifteen years later, i'm in atlanta. Georgia. It's a different world, but it was deja vu all over again.  : 14:57:03
ted : As doctors, we see our patients who have chronic illnesses in an episodic way. In between, the patients have to learn how to make a lot of decisions for themselves. I'll give you examples if you have. Medications are supposed take everyday. What do you do when you're sick? Ah. You still suppose?  : 14:57:42
ted : To take it, how do you recognize a complication when it happens? How do you recognize a side effect when it happens? What do you do with it? In addition to all of this, they're dealing with the inevitable loneliness, isolation and anxiety. The people who have chronic illnesses deal with in the us alone.  : 14:58:39
ted : Six in ten adults have a chronic illness that's a hundred and twenty five million people.  : 14:59:35
ted : A recent report from the robert wood johnson foundation showed that health habits account for fifty percent of the health outcomes of people experience, while medical care only accounts for twenty percent. In fact, the centers for disease control says that if we could.  : 14:59:56
ted : Eliminate smoking, physical activity and poor nutrition. The we can prevent eighty percent of heart disease, eighty percent of type two diabetes and forty percent of cancer. But we also know that changing health behaviors is very difficult.  : 15:00:52
ted : So we ask the question, what if what if we could create a resource that could motivate people to change health behaviour?  : 15:01:49
ted : The truth is there are a lot of these resources out there that help people acquire the so called self management skills.  : 15:02:20
ted : But many a time they are not easily accessible or relatable, particularly to individuals within minority and underserved communities who faced bias in addition to barriers like language and culture and inadequate health insurance coverage.  : 15:02:44
ted : And so in the last twelve years, my colleagues and that more house school of medicine have created a technology based application to assist with chronic illness care.  : 15:03:35
ted : It's freely available on the web and as an app. And what we do is we get people to track variables, blood pressure, blood sugar and their report it back to them in a colour coded format, so green would indicate a healthy range and red would indicate a problem they need something done about it.  : 15:04:02
ted : We link the starts to a curriculum. The curriculum helps the individual learn about their health condition, whatever it is, whatever the chronic illnesses, they also work with the health coach to learn self management skills skills that help them prevent complications of their illness.  : 15:04:57
ted : In order for the coach to be successful, they have to be able to gain the trust of the individual that they're working with. We tested this application in it in clinics, where the health coaches where medical assistance, and in a large urban church, where the health coaches with volunteers from the health <unk>  : 15:05:54
ted : Ministry.  : 15:06:51
ted : A year later, a third of the participants were able to acquire three new self management skills and maintain them to the extent that he was able to improve their blood pressures, their blood sugars and their exercise. Now, what was simple, yet fascinating to us, was that.  : 15:06:56
ted : The group from the church did just as well, or even better than the group that were on the purely medical care, and we wanted to learn why that was so we looked a little further into the research. Four hundred hours have recorded a conversation, and what we learned was that the coaches from the church  : 15:07:52
ted : Did have more time to spend with the patients. They had access to the patients families and so they could figure out what people needed and provide those resources for them. My team and i call this culturally, congo in coaching. To illustrate the concept of culturally congress coaching, i want to tell you about  : 15:08:47
ted : One of our patients. Alcohol for miss bertha?  : 15:09:43
ted : So miss versus an eighty three year old lady with diabetes and hypertension she was assigned to and her health coach and the church, and also happens to be a family. Friends from his birth have for many years and they were fellow congregants.  : 15:09:53
ted : Observed after the first few visits, that even though miss brace of faithfully recorded her starts, they were all showing up as red. So she proved a little deeper. To try to understand what was going on with miss bertha and miss brace gave her the real real.  : 15:10:36
ted : She told her that there were times when her medications that made her feel weird and she wouldn't take them the way they were prescribed, because she thought it was due to the medicines. But she didn't tell her doctor that she also skipped out on some doctor appointments for variety of reasons. But one of them was, she wasn't doing better and she didn't want.  : 15:11:24
ted : To make her doctor mad, so she just didn't go so.  : 15:12:18
ted : And talk to miss birth and asked her to bring her daughter and for the next visit, which she did. And at that visit.  : 15:12:31
ted : And was able to pronounce a log of all these starts from his birth had been collecting. Gave them to encourage them to go see the data together, which they did. With that information, the data was able to make changes to miss versus treatment and like within three months ms versus numbers were all in the green. Now no one was more excited.  : 15:12:51
ted : Or surprise, that miss breathless herself now and was successful as a health coach, because she cared enough to go below the surface and probe ms versus deep culture and was able to reach that level. She knew how to listen and she knew how to ask the right questions to get to what was needed.  : 15:13:48
ted : We all have deep, unconscious rules the drive the way we make our health decisions. That's our culture. The relationship and the conversation between anonymous birthday illustrates what's possible when we have conversations with our patients, our friends and our neighbours.  : 15:14:44
ted : On a deep cultural level, and personally, i'm beyond excited to think that with this simple concept of culturally, colin coaching, we could change the lives of one hundred and twenty five million americans and many others across the world that are living with chronic diseases. Thank you.  : 15:15:41
