posting text:  appam.
called
called
posting text:  sharing lah.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  uh mainly because of financial situations if er yah that's why i'm trying to look for any er sponsors that is able to sponsor me but uh then again i have to look at the current situation them in and see whether it is a good choice or not.
called
posting text:  right.
posting text:  yeah to go yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah of course lah.
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  it's kind of it's really a good choice to go to university i definitely i mean even in terms of your starting pay is is already a good choice because like uni students tend to earn that much higher pay as you go through our like the big the four major universities like n t u n u s s m u o r d.
called
called
posting text:  um.
posting text:  s a s u s s u t d there's there's this new universal or s i t lah.

called
posting text:  or or good choices for you and i'm sure that there are four scholarship programs.
called
posting text:  yeah of course i will try to do is that because in bali i don't have uh any c c a.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  that's why it might be a lot of not wrong a lot of er uni stood only look at g p a d also look at the whatever equipment you have done in er in your in your body.
called
called
posting text:  a life so like currently i have nothing uh even though i tried to start the cca in a body but uh.

posting text:  i feel really because there's not enough ah.
called
posting text:  the manpower and also uh.
called
called
posting text:  mostly finances are but they are just not enough manpower and also not enough time for me to kickstart the c c properly.
called
posting text:  c c a.
posting text:  so i'm currently uh.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  i m doing well people noise archery tag but ya it was also known as a food marjorie basically it's a mix of our three plus starch ball.
called
posting text:  wow.
called
called

called
posting text:  three.

posting text:  and pinball yeah so it is a place you played the play the game like dodgeball so if you get hit by the ball or you can hit by the arrow ya oh if you catch the ball ball the person they threw the ball is out so seventy four four three you catch the arrow the person that shot the arrow is out and then by the unique thing for former treaties that day.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  we also have these are boards like this target board on the floor and then there's like four sports four to five spots on it so if you shoot one of the sports out the dead man from wherever they did on your team gets to get revived yah so it's a very interesting spoilt i started it in a it and then i play competitively.
called
posting text:  i have my own team ah.
posting text:  hm.
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah i run my own team and then er we go to multiple competitions are and then but when i come a poly i didn't have any c c a.

called
posting text:  he is also a kick starting this year here but uh.
called
called
posting text:  many people.
called
called
called
posting text:  not many people for my i t manage to go to poly especially knee and uh but yeah lah so that's why i didn't have so much uh support to kickstart the c c but do now i still go for training ah my own team.
posting text:  right.
called
called
posting text:  as in like so other than trying to kick start a cca also too in order to continue playing i i myself is a.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  er i kickstart this a tournament in singapore so i work with another company to kickstart this tournament and for other players to join this tournament and play especially those er er the one that just started because currently there is no tournament so i just decided to just make one for myself and and uh.
called
posting text:  i see.
called
posting text:  like other people play yah there's a drink.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  and of course the application.
posting text:  to your.
called
posting text:  activities even though it's doesn't belong to your school.
called
called
posting text:  certainly some leadership qualities.
called
called
posting text:  additional skills like universities might find attractive to ninth.
called
posting text:  diversity to the student body.
posting text:  of course lah but.
called
called
posting text:  because it's not official at the sport yourself is not that strong.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  are mainly because it's only the students ips only expose snow so much of bali secondary school already tertiary levels so you don't need it so it's not very solid to the point where i have heard that other schools might not be too confident needed because neon itself wasn't too confident into the sport.
called
posting text:  i see.
called
posting text:  i will still try to edit in er of course it's still my resume now but uh see how it goes.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  you need to.

posting text:  so.
posting text:  what do you do it.
called
called
posting text:  okay.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  i also added a mechanical engineering are mainly because i didn't know what type of course i want to do but i know i didn't want to do business mainly because i had to memorise the hospitality same thing also i was into it or engineering but i was more passionate about engineering course i see the thing.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  do is more interesting and from engineering you can just go to any man can specialize in a lot of things so my dad recommended me to take make a chronic since he's a mix of a mechanical electronics so i did it for two years er from er er from n levels ah i went for this program called the a direct poly program so basically you have.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  who spent two years in ninety get a minimum of two point five and then you're guaranteed a spot bali so yeah so i did that i did well for one it and then uh yah so when i moved to poly i was honestly i was quite scared i didn't know whether the difficulty.
called
called
called
posting text:  in terms of studying it would be very white rabbit whether there's going to be a big difference but i think it's okay ah it's not bad ah.
called
called
posting text:  yeah lah but of course definitely is tougher and er ya lah especially with this er in terms of modern.
called
called
posting text:  however.
called
posting text:  it's a bit like scary lah because you also never do anything because i d i d i honestly i enjoyed it and much more.
called
called
called
posting text:  oh.
posting text:  if i can do my diploma in it like my teacher said at the lecture there uh i find that they are more.
called
called
posting text:  they care about their students more there are going to do anything foreign students they really helped me a lot.
called
posting text:  help me my confidence especially because i didn't do so well in secondary school.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  i like confidence i didn't i didn't know computer do therefore no motivation to carry on doing by ninety basically you're just like we said for me then i managed to do so from there my confident went up my studies when better and i use the same attitude ninety to bali.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  for your for your g p..
called
posting text:  yes yes.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yes.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  it's good that you.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  you too.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  funny thing is that i myself i always find myself very uh.
called
posting text:  lazy.
posting text:  lizzie at times yeah.
called
posting text:  because like i have a lot of things going on outside ah.
called
posting text:  it by the sport yourself the my own team ah.
called
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  the skull and then er my work part time job and then yah so there's a lot of things going on and sometimes like especially bali i at last semester started to slip of a bit uh mainly because there's a lot of things to memorize so i didn't like to memorise the false or more of like.
called
called
posting text:  the calculating star depends on staff there used to be so corporation wise autos module that requires a calculations a house.
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  it was quite easy formula but those things that requires a memory work especially when it doesn't make sense to me that one is really quite bad lah yah so that's why this last semester i r a s.
posting text:  right.
called
called
posting text:  exactly my gp to drop but i'm fine i mean really to myself i can expect much ya.
called
posting text:  good.
posting text:  hopefully after this intern then you'll be back up again.
called
called
posting text:  but i'm finding my current gp as long ago both trees at the empty yeah.
called
posting text:  three.
called
called
posting text:  one.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  no lah because like i cannot expect too much also because like like my dad also say like you could expect too much as when you start to drop and there's when you get you get discipline disappointed in yourself we easily like you must give yourself some leeway like some of the.
posting text:  oh.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  that you do in school sometimes not your fault but you also can ah like the team mates are like do anything they have to do the whole slice yourself which i experienced a lot in bali where to do the whole project myself because my teammates basically lizzie yeah just lazy or they just i don't know lah they just don't know.
posting text:  do be doing lah.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  just enough or maybe just enough to go uni display as long as my uh attitude and my personality doesn't change that i think it is more important than grades la i don't see grades as such an important thing as compared to the attitude that you should do other things.
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  oh.
called
posting text:  i think mainly because he was one of these in the army lah so.
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  hm.
called
posting text:  really.

called
called
posting text:  maybe.
posting text:  yeah.
called
called
posting text:  yeah.
posting text:  yeah.

posting text:  so uh.
posting text:  three.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  he's working the army officer commander army officer lah so he's a he's he's he's a major now if i'm not wrong yah so yah lah so he spent most of his after suicide on in from the u k we think what do we do know so yeah lah so a lot of these are things that you do.
called
posting text:  a lot of guys so a lot of those uh.
called
called
posting text:  leadership things especially when i'm managing my own team ah.
called
called
called
called
called
called
posting text:  i like to find sponsors to drive people to do stuff together as a team a lot of times i am i seek advice from him because he knows how people behave he understands what people one and he also teach me how to be a proper leader myself in like talk to people like everybody wants to be.
called
called
called
called
posting text:  to each other but sometimes the words that you see is how you say that can change people yah so like especially when you want to scold people like you don't mean to school school because you keep them is more of like you want them to learn.
called
called
called
posting text:  this kind of thing that he will teach me to be careful of what i see because he knows that i don't mean.
called
called
called
posting text:  i mean to be bad but you just agreed i thought yeah so we just kind of thing that he teaches me to be careful and yah just basically helped me a lot.
called
posting text:  for my outside activities.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  yeah.
called
posting text:  one.
posting text:  yeah.

can do my diploma in it like my teacher said at the lecture there uh i find that they are more. they care about their students more there are going to do anything foreign students they really helped me a lot. help me my confidence especially because i didn't do so well in secondary school. i like confidence i didn't i didn't know computer do therefore no motivation to carry on doing by ninety basically you're just like we said for me then i managed to do so from there my confident went up my studies when better and i use the same attitude ninety to bali. yeah. yeah. yes yes. yeah. yeah. yeah. funny thing is that i myself i always find myself very uh. lizzie at times yeah. because like i have a lot of things going on outside ah. it by the sport yourself the my own team ah. the skull and then er my work part time job and then yah so there's a lot of things going on and sometimes like especially bali i at last semester started to slip of a bit uh mainly because there's a lot of things to memorize so i didn't like to memorise the false or more of like. the calculating star depends on staff there used to be so corporation wise autos module that requires a calculations a house. it was quite easy formula but those things that requires a memory work especially when it doesn't make sense to me that one is really quite bad lah yah so that's why this last semester i r a s. exactly my gp to drop but i'm fine i mean really to myself i can expect much ya. hopefully after this intern then you'll be back up again. but i'm finding my current gp as long ago both trees at the empty yeah. no lah because like i cannot expect too much also because like like my dad also say like you could expect too much as when you start to drop and there's when you get you get discipline disappointed in yourself we easily like you must give yourself some leeway like some of the. that you do in school sometimes not your fault but you also can ah like the team mates are like do anything they have to do the whole slice yourself which i experienced a lot in bali where to do the whole project myself because my teammates basically lizzie yeah just lazy or they just i don't know lah they just don't know. do be doing lah. just enough or maybe just enough to go uni display as long as my uh attitude and my personality doesn't change that i think it is more important than grades la i don't see grades as such an important thing as compared to the attitude that you should do other things. yeah. i think mainly because he was one of these in the army lah so. yeah yeah. hm. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. so uh. he's working the army officer commander army officer lah so he's a he's he's he's a major now if i'm not wrong yah so yah lah so he spent most of his after suicide on in from the u k we think what do we do know so yeah lah so a lot of these are things that you do. a lot of guys so a lot of those uh. leadership things especially when i'm managing my own team ah. i like to find sponsors to drive people to do stuff together as a team a lot of times i am i seek advice from him because he knows how people behave he understands what people one and he also teach me how to be a proper leader myself in like talk to people like everybody wants to be. to each other but sometimes the words that you see is how you say that can change people yah so like especially when you want to scold people like you don't mean to school school because you keep them is more of like you want them to learn. this kind of thing that he will teach me to be careful of what i see because he knows that i don't mean. i mean to be bad but you just agreed i thought yeah so we just kind of thing that he teaches me to be careful and yah just basically helped me a lot. for my outside activities. yeah. yeah. hmm. yeah. yeah. yeah. uh i'm not really sure what he did for ndp. he told me one time that oh i'm going to be something the bb. yeah you don't want that shopping. once more to them than like i think you got tired because of the constant training they you have to go every week. he also have other things to do for you to work so every year is to go out uh. overseas australia brunei that kind of thing so sometimes he doesn't have time to. military training exercises. i think this way you start. d p p. yeah. um. yeah. yeah. hm. yeah. so uh i don't know what's going to happen. i have a military that but. like i don't okay uh going to ns and multiple automatically sees it as a very bad thing no waste of two years but to me honestly if this is two years there you can't run away then mixed messages make full use of it or enjoy your time there from friends in your your platoon mates lah so. yeah lah so i don't know uh be well i'll be doing i don't know if i played my data plan i heard he can actually affect my uh we're supposed to do actually yah but i honestly i don't really care ah. because like whatever happens happens and i just have to make full use of it or something i don't i don't be born abroad. yeah just. yeah lah yeah so. yeah so at least one i'm actually looking forward to it. a lot of people but actually i'm quite excited for it. yeah because it's going to be a very fun to use that he's going to be the end of the day it's going to be another memory for me to share my friends talk about it. yeah of course senior in inside and as you suffer. this kind of thing but i just i guess you just buy bottles. and uh so uh i'm just thinking about the experience that i could get out of it. yeah of course ah getting news making new friends. are getting closer friends um you know they always say that when you suffer together as a group the group tends to be closer so definitely looking forward to that. airborne. also the then of course when things will be more exposed to whatever things that they need to do. we know what army people do it at work i see them only doing paperwork but i hope they thought that they thought the kids only. so ya lah. it's just to excuse myself out there this year. hopefully be good lah yeah. uh.
