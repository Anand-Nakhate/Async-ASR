One : Okay. Never mind. Yeah. So, uh i mean it is. I mean, it's very normal type audience are concerned, are worried, especially, you know, since your student, as he don't really have much experience with a working lah. So basically, an internship will give you a glimpse of how is it like to work after after you graduate?  : 13:39:56
Two : Yeah.  : 13:40:34
One : Like beer after poly, or after uni? So, i suppose, er, you what? We would like to go to uni. Right.  : 13:40:57

Two : My d p is high, but there's also other factors that might affect wider reason why can't go. I cannot go. I can't go lah, basically. But of course, if i can i will. If i cannot, then it's just too bad. But i always wanted to try to go for overseas.  : 13:41:37
One : Okay.  : 13:42:02
Two : Intern or overseas? Ah.  : 13:42:42
Two : University. Er. Just like my father when he went to australia for his uni, i think. Ah, then i. We went there. Also went to australia or not? I think. A few years back to check out he's a campus. And i think it was quite interesting. Different culture, a. Everyone's different. Er, especially since students laying down on the grass.  : 13:42:52
One : Oh.  : 13:43:24
One : Student.  : 13:43:47
Two : The other three. That's very different.  : 13:43:52
One : Yeah.  : 13:43:58
Two : We don't see any students doing that in singapore. Yah.  : 13:44:01
One : Yeah. I mean okay lah cause. I mean the ang moh country before. So they are always this habit of, er, you know, sunbathing, lor, then they sit on the grass, so it's like to ask the grateful dirty then. But then i have to say, like, because they think that, you know, all the light but the fresh, outdoor and nature. Yeah. Yeah.  : 13:44:07
Two : Yeah.  : 13:44:14
Two : Yeah.  : 13:44:30

One : Okay.  : 13:45:16
Two : And i went there. It was, quite did. Nobody was around but.  : 13:45:29
One : Or is it like doing as a semester break or something?  : 13:45:36
Two : I'm not sure. But i think is. I don't know, because i just follow my father. But there was still some students around. Lah. But we just went there for a while then, like we just went back to the hotel. Or just relax, you just for my father to check out this place lah. Because he misses that place. Ya.  : 13:45:44
One : Oh.  : 13:46:22
One : Oh, i see. So do plan to pour his sister and go go to overseas.  : 13:46:36
Two : Uh.  : 13:46:52
Two : Same thing. Lah. If i can lah but if?  : 13:46:56
One : Appam.  : 13:47:04
Two : Uh. Mainly because of financial situations, if, er, yah. That's why i'm trying to look for any, er. Sponsors that is able to sponsor me. But, uh. Then again, i have to look at the current situation, them in, and see whether it is a good choice or not.  : 13:47:12
One : Sharing. Lah.  : 13:47:24
One : Right.  : 13:48:09
Two : Yeah, to go, yeah.  : 13:48:09
One : It's kind of. It's really a good choice to go to university. I definitely. I mean, even in terms of your starting pay is is already a good choice because like uni students tend to earn that much higher pay as you go through our, like, the big, the four major universities like n t u n u s s, m u o r d.  : 13:48:15
Two : Yeah, of course. Lah.  : 13:48:24
One : S a s u s, s u t d there's there's this new universal, or s i t lah?  : 13:49:14
Two : Um.  : 13:49:32
One : Or or good choices for you and i'm sure that there are four scholarship programs,  : 13:49:35
Two : Yeah.  : 13:49:48
Two : Yeah, of course i will try to do. Is that because in bali, i don't have, uh, any c c a  : 13:50:00
Two : That's why it might be a lot of not wrong. A lot of, er, uni stood only. Look at g p a d. Also look at the whatever equipment you have done in, er, in your, in your body.  : 13:50:18
Two : A life so like currently i have nothing, uh. Even though i tried to start the cca in a body, but, uh.  : 13:50:55
Two : I feel really because there's not enough. Ah.  : 13:51:19
Two : The manpower. And also, uh.  : 13:51:28
Two : Mostly finances are, but they are just not enough manpower and also not enough time for me to kickstart the c c properly.  : 13:51:36
One : C c a  : 13:51:57
Two : So i'm currently. Uh.  : 13:52:02
Two : I m doing well. People noise archery. Tag but ya. It was also known as a food, marjorie. Basically, it's a mix of our three plus starch ball.  : 13:52:11
Two : And pinball? Yeah, so it is a place you played the play the game like dodgeball. So if you get hit by the ball, or you can hit by the arrow, ya. Oh. If you catch the ball ball, the person they threw the ball is out. So seventy four four three, you catch the arrow. The person that shot the arrow is out. And then by the unique thing for former treaties that day?  : 13:52:45
One : Wow.  : 13:52:50
One : Three.  : 13:53:37
Two : We also have these are boards like this target board on the floor. And then there's like four sports, four to five spots on it. So if you shoot one of the sports out, the dead man from wherever they did on your team gets to get revived. Yah. So it's a very interesting spoilt. I started it in a it and then i play competitively.  : 13:53:46
Two : I have my own team. Ah.  : 13:54:48
Two : Yeah, i run my own team and then, er. We go to multiple competitions are and then. But when i come a poly i didn't have any c c a  : 13:54:54
One : Hm.  : 13:54:56
Two : He is also a kick starting this year here. But, uh.  : 13:55:29
Two : Not many people, for my. I t manage to go to poly. Especially knee and uh. But yeah lah. So that's why i didn't have so much, uh. Support to kickstart the c c, but do now i still go for training. Ah, my own team.  : 13:55:47
One : Many people.  : 13:56:00
One : Right.  : 13:56:32
Two : As in like so, other than trying to kick start a cca also too, in order to continue playing, i i myself is a  : 13:56:33
Two : Er, i kickstart this a tournament in singapore, so i work with another company to kickstart this tournament and for other players to join this tournament and play especially those, er, er. The one that just started, because currently there is no tournament, so i just decided to just make one for myself and, and, uh.  : 13:56:59
Two : Like other people play yah, there's a drink.  : 13:58:01
One : I see.  : 13:58:07
One : And, of course, the application.  : 13:58:16
Two : Yeah.  : 13:58:20
One : To your  : 13:58:22
One : Activities, even though it's doesn't belong to your school?  : 13:58:29
One : Certainly some leadership qualities.  : 13:58:41
One : Additional skills, like universities might find attractive to ninth  : 13:58:55
One : Diversity to the student body.  : 13:59:15
Two : Of course. Lah. But.  : 13:59:20
Two : Because it's not official at the sport yourself is not that strong.  : 13:59:29
Two : Are mainly because it's only the students ips only expose snow so much of bali secondary school already tertiary levels, so you don't need it, so it's not very solid to the point where i have heard that other schools might not be too confident. Needed because neon itself wasn't too confident into the sport.  : 13:59:45
Two : I will still try to edit in. Er, of course, it's still my resume now, but, uh, see how it goes.  : 14:00:46
One : I see.  : 14:00:55
Two : Yeah.  : 14:01:07
One : You need to.  : 14:01:08
One : Why not? You know why not you.  : 14:01:16
Two : Yeah.  : 14:01:23
One : I think that is your professional. Over the spot narratives.  : 14:01:27
One : One promoting it, maybe even n t u  : 14:01:37
Two : Yeah.  : 14:01:51
One : House? Of course.  : 14:02:01
Two : Sure.  : 14:02:11
One : For me, this something.  : 14:02:20
One : Nine point forty.  : 14:02:32
One : Please look for any one to transition from it to poly life.  : 14:02:43
Two : Yeah.  : 14:02:47
Two : So?  : 14:03:00
One : What do you do it?  : 14:03:02
Two : I also added a mechanical engineering are mainly because i didn't know what type of course i want to do, but i know i didn't want to do business, mainly because i had to memorise the hospitality. Same thing. Also, i was into it or engineering, but i was more passionate about engineering. Course. I see the thing.  : 14:03:08
One : Okay.  : 14:03:22
Two : Do is more interesting. And from engineering you can just go to. Any man can specialize in a lot of things. So my dad recommended me to take make a chronic, since he's a mix of a mechanical electronics. So i did it for two years, er. From, er. Er. From n levels. Ah. I went for this program called the a direct poly program. So basically, you have.  : 14:04:05
Two : Who spent two years in ninety, get a minimum of two point five and then you're guaranteed a spot. Bali, so, yeah. So i did that. I did well for one it and then, uh yah. So when i moved to poly, i was. Honestly, i was quite scared. I didn't know whether the difficulty.  : 14:05:07
One : Yeah.  : 14:05:43
Two : In terms of studying, it would be very white rabbit. Whether there's going to be a big difference, but i think it's okay. Ah. It's not bad. Ah.  : 14:06:09
Two : Yeah. Lah. But of course, definitely is tougher and, er, ya lah. Especially with this, er. In terms of modern.  : 14:06:39
Two : It's a bit like scary lah, because you also never do anything because i d i d i honestly, i enjoyed it and much more.  : 14:07:00
One : However.  : 14:07:20
Two : If i can do my diploma in it, like my teacher said at the lecture there. Uh i find that they are more  : 14:07:27
One : Oh.  : 14:07:52
Two : They care about their students more there are going to do anything. Foreign students. They really helped me a lot.  : 14:07:56
Two : Help me my confidence, especially because i didn't do so well in secondary school.  : 14:08:15
Two : I like confidence. I didn't, i didn't know computer do. Therefore no motivation to carry on doing by ninety. Basically, you're just like we said for me. Then i managed to do so. From there, my confident went up. My studies when better and i use the same attitude. Ninety to bali.  : 14:08:28
Two : Yeah.  : 14:09:30
Two : Yeah.  : 14:09:36
One : For your. For your g p.  : 14:09:40
Two : Yes. Yes.  : 14:09:53
Two : Yeah.  : 14:10:03
One : Yes.  : 14:10:04
Two : Yeah.  : 14:10:19
One : Yeah.  : 14:10:20
One : It's good that you.  : 14:10:28
Two : Yeah.  : 14:10:49
One : You too.  : 14:10:50
Two : Funny thing is that i myself. I always find myself very uh.  : 14:11:01
One : Yeah.  : 14:11:05
Two : Lizzie at times, yeah.  : 14:11:17
One : Lazy.  : 14:11:20
Two : Because, like, i have a lot of things going on outside. Ah.  : 14:11:26
Two : It by the sport yourself. The my own team. Ah.  : 14:11:38
Two : The skull and then, er. My work, part time job. And then. Yah. So there's a lot of things going on and sometimes like. Especially bali. I at last semester, started to slip of a bit. Uh. Mainly because there's a lot of things to memorize, so i didn't like to memorise the false, or more of like.  : 14:11:52
Two : The calculating star depends on staff. There used to be so corporation wise autos module that requires a calculations a house.  : 14:12:52
Two : It was quite easy formula, but those things that requires a memory work, especially when it doesn't make sense to me. That one is really quite bad. Lah yah. So that's why, this last semester i r a s.  : 14:13:21
One : Right.  : 14:14:01
Two : Exactly my gp to drop, but i'm fine. I mean, really to myself i can expect much ya.  : 14:14:01
Two : Hopefully after this intern then you'll be back up again.  : 14:14:24
One : Good.  : 14:14:33
Two : But i'm finding my current gp as long ago. Both trees at the empty. Yeah.  : 14:14:41
One : Three.  : 14:15:05
Two : No lah, because, like, i cannot expect too much. Also, because, like, like my dad also say, like, you could expect too much as when you start to drop and there's when you get, you get discipline, disappointed in yourself. We easily like. You must give yourself some leeway. Like some of the  : 14:15:08
One : One.  : 14:15:21
Two : That you do in school sometimes not your fault. But you also can, ah, like. The team mates are like, do anything. They have to do the whole slice yourself, which i experienced a lot in bali. Where to do the whole project myself? Because my teammates, basically, lizzie. Yeah. Just lazy or they just. I don't know lah. They just don't know.  : 14:16:03
One : Oh.  : 14:16:09
Two : Do be doing lah.  : 14:17:04
Two : Just enough or maybe just enough to go uni display as long as my uh attitude and my personality doesn't change that, i think it is more important than grades la i don't see grades as such an important thing as compared to the attitude that you should do other things.  : 14:17:13
Two : Yeah.  : 14:18:05
One : Oh.  : 14:18:10
Two : I think mainly because he was one of these in the army. Lah. So.  : 14:18:15
One : Yeah.  : 14:18:32
Two : Yeah, yeah.  : 14:18:36
One : Yeah.  : 14:18:48
Two : Hm.  : 14:18:54
One : Really?  : 14:19:04
Two : Yeah.  : 14:19:09
One : Yeah.  : 14:19:20
One : Yeah.  : 14:19:36
Two : Yeah.  : 14:19:40
One : Five.  : 14:19:53
Two : Yeah.  : 14:19:56
One : Maybe.  : 14:20:25
Two : Yeah.  : 14:20:29
One : Yeah.  : 14:20:41
Two : Yeah.  : 14:20:45
Two : So, uh.  : 14:20:50
Two : He's working the army officer commander army officer. Lah. So he's a he's he's he's a major now. If i'm not wrong. Yah. So yah lah. So he spent most of his after suicide on in from the u k. We think, what do we do know? So, yeah, lah. So a lot of these are things that you do.  : 14:20:53
One : Three.  : 14:20:57
Two : A lot of guys. So a lot of those, uh.  : 14:21:56
Two : Leadership things? Especially when i'm managing my own team. Ah.  : 14:22:12
Two : I like to find sponsors to drive people to do stuff together as a team. A lot of times i am i seek advice from him because he knows how people behave. He understands what people one. And he also teach me how to be a proper leader myself, in, like, talk to people like everybody wants to be.  : 14:22:24
Two : To each other. But sometimes the words that you see is how you say that can change people. Yah. So like. Especially when you want to scold people like you don't mean to school, school, because you keep them is more of like, you want them to learn.  : 14:23:25
Two : This kind of thing, that he will teach me to be careful of what i see, because he knows that i don't mean  : 14:24:11
Two : I mean to be bad, but you just agreed, i thought, yeah. So we just kind of thing, that he teaches me to be careful and yah. Just basically helped me a lot.  : 14:24:34
Two : For my outside activities.  : 14:25:09
One : Yeah.  : 14:25:28
Two : Yeah.  : 14:25:35

Two : Yeah.  : 14:26:49
Two : Yeah.  : 14:27:06
Two : Uh i'm not really sure what he did for ndp.  : 14:27:20

Two : He told me one time that, oh, i'm going to be something. The bb.  : 14:27:28
Two : Yeah. You don't want that shopping.  : 14:27:43
Two : Once, more to them than like, i think you got tired because of the constant training, they you have to go every week.  : 14:27:49
Two : He also have other things to do for you to work. So every year is to go out. Uh.  : 14:28:08
Two : Overseas, australia, brunei, that kind of thing. So sometimes he doesn't have time to  : 14:28:27
Two : Military training exercises?  : 14:28:43

Two : D p p.  : 14:29:05

Two : Hm.  : 14:30:45
One : Yeah.  : 14:30:47
Two : Yeah.  : 14:30:55
Two : So, uh. I don't know what's going to happen.  : 14:31:02
One : Yeah.  : 14:31:03
Two : I have a military that, but  : 14:31:15
Two : Like i don't. Okay, uh. Going to ns and multiple automatically sees it as a very bad thing, no waste of two years. But to me, honestly, if this is two years there, you can't run away, then mixed messages make full use of it. Or enjoy your time there from friends in your your platoon mates. Lah. So.  : 14:31:28
Two : Yeah. Lah. So i don't know. Uh. Be. Well, i'll be doing. I don't know if i played my data plan. I heard he can actually affect my, uh. We're supposed to do actually. Yah. But i honestly. I don't really care. Ah.  : 14:32:28
Two : Because, like, whatever happens happens, and i just have to make full use of it or something. I don't. I don't be born abroad.  : 14:33:08
Two : Yeah, just  : 14:33:35
Two : Yeah, lah. Yeah. So.  : 14:33:45

Two : A lot of people, but actually i'm quite excited for it.  : 14:34:03
Two : Yeah, because it's going to be a very fun to use that. He's going to be the end of the day. It's going to be another memory for me to share. My friends talk about it.  : 14:34:15
Two : Yeah, of course, senior in inside and as you suffer.  : 14:34:44
Two : This kind of thing. But i just. I guess, you just buy bottles.  : 14:35:00

Two : Yeah, of course. Ah. Getting news. Making new friends.  : 14:35:42
Two : Are getting closer friends. Um, you know, they always say that when you suffer together as a group, the group tends to be closer. So definitely looking forward to that.  : 14:35:52
Two : Airborne.  : 14:36:27
Two : Also the then, of course, when things will be more exposed to whatever things that they need to do.  : 14:36:34
Two : We know what army people do it at work. I see them only doing paperwork but i hope they thought that. They thought the kids only  : 14:37:02
Two : So ya lah.  : 14:37:23
